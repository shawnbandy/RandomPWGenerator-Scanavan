Original Assignment Goals:
1. When button is clicked, user is to be prompted with prompts for password criteria 
2. User should be able to select which type of criteria to include
2a. These criteria include: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters 
2b. When criteria is selected, password MUST contain at least one character from each type selected
3. User should be able to choose length of password from 8-128 characters long
4. A password should be generated after answering all criteria 
5. Password should be displayed to user 

This was achieved by:
1. Adding a function to the button click event. Function shows user a series of prompts at top of page which user can interact with
2. Interactive prompts cycle through different types of criteria. These criteria include all of above character types listed, and are immediately included into the password
3. User is prompted with password length and defaults to either the min/max value if user incorrectly inputs value
4. Password is generated according to user's input to meet length and criteria 
5. Password is displayed for user in the password box


Application Description: 
This application generates a random password depending on user specifications. The user is able to select from a different criteria of characters, such as lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and other special characters, as well as password length. Password contents change depending on user's criteria specifications, and the final password is displayed on the page for user to copy.
